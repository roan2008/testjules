## 🚨 Issue Report Example

### ISSUE REPORT - Database Performance Degradation
**Reporter**: Development Team  
**Date**: June 8, 2025  
**Priority**: HIGH 🔴  
**Phase Impact**: Phase 4 Development

#### 🚧 Issue Description
Database queries for Projects and Models listing are experiencing slow response times (>2 seconds) when testing with larger datasets (500+ records).

#### 📊 Impact Assessment
- **Timeline Impact**: Potential 1-2 day delay if not resolved quickly
- **User Experience**: Unacceptable loading times for production use
- **Phase 4 Progress**: Blocks completion of Day 2 objectives

#### 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

#### 💡 Proposed Solution
1. **Immediate** (2 hours): Add database indexes for critical columns
2. **Short-term** (4 hours): Optimize queries with proper JOINs
3. **Medium-term** (1 day): Implement query caching mechanism

#### 🆘 Assistance Needed
- **DBA Review**: Need database administrator to review index strategy
- **Code Review**: Senior developer review of query optimization
- **Testing**: Need staging environment with production-size dataset

#### ⏰ Timeline
- **Resolution Target**: End of day June 8, 2025
- **Escalation**: If not resolved by 6 PM, escalate to Technical Lead

### 🚨 Critical Bug Debug Report Example

#### 🚨 CRITICAL: Database Connection Pool Exhaustion
**Reporter**: QA Team  
**Date**: June 11, 2025, 11:30 AM  
**Priority**: CRITICAL 🔴  
**Investigator**: Senior Developer  

##### 🐛 Bug Description
**Summary**: Application becomes unresponsive after ~50 concurrent users
**Environment**: Staging server (mirrors production)
**First Observed**: June 11, 2025, 10:45 AM
**Frequency**: Consistent under load

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Load test with 50+ concurrent users
2. Each user performs CRUD operations on projects
3. After ~10 minutes, new requests start failing
4. Database connections show as "Sleep" in processlist

**Expected**: System handles 100+ concurrent users
**Actual**: System fails after 50 concurrent users

##### 🔍 Investigation Process
**Tools Used**:
- MySQL SHOW PROCESSLIST
- PHP-FPM status page
- Apache server-status
- htop for system resources
- New Relic APM

**Time Spent**: 3 hours

##### 📊 Debug Findings

**Database Analysis**:
```sql
SHOW PROCESSLIST;
-- Result: 151 connections, 130 in "Sleep" state

SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'max_connections';
-- Result: max_connections = 151

SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Threads_connected';
-- Result: Threads_connected = 151 (at limit!)

SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Connection_errors_max_connections';
-- Result: 47 connection errors due to limit
```

**PHP Connection Analysis**:
```php
// Found: Database connections not being properly closed
class Database {
    public static function connect() {
        // Problem: Creating new PDO without storing reference
        return new PDO($dsn, $user, $pass);
        // Connections not being reused or closed!
    }
}
```

**Root Cause**: 
1. Database class creating new connections instead of reusing
2. Connections not being explicitly closed
3. PHP garbage collection not cleaning up fast enough under load
4. MySQL max_connections too low for expected load

##### 💡 Solution Implemented
**Immediate Fix (30 minutes)**:
```php
// Updated Database.php with connection pooling
class Database {
    private static $pdo = null;
    
    public static function connect() {
        if (self::$pdo === null) {
            self::$pdo = new PDO($dsn, $user, $pass, [
                PDO::ATTR_PERSISTENT => true,
                PDO::ATTR_TIMEOUT => 5
            ]);
        }
        return self::$pdo;
    }
    
    public static function close() {
        self::$pdo = null;
    }
}
```

**Configuration Fix**:
```sql
-- Increased MySQL limits
SET GLOBAL max_connections = 500;
SET GLOBAL wait_timeout = 300;
SET GLOBAL interactive_timeout = 300;
```

**PHP-FPM Optimization**:
```ini
; Updated php-fpm pool config
pm.max_children = 50
pm.start_servers = 10
pm.min_spare_servers = 5
pm.max_spare_servers = 20
pm.max_requests = 1000
```

##### 🧪 Fix Verification
**Load Test Results After Fix**:
```
Before Fix:
- Max concurrent users: 50
- Failure rate: 15% after 10 minutes
- Database connections: 151 (maxed out)

After Fix:
- Max concurrent users: 200+ ✅
- Failure rate: 0% after 30 minutes ✅
- Database connections: 25 average ✅
- Response time: 180ms avg ✅
```

**Monitoring Setup**:
- Added database connection monitoring
- Alert when connections > 80% of limit
- Automated restart if connections stuck

##### 📝 Prevention Measures
1. **Code Review**: Added connection management to checklist
2. **Load Testing**: Automated daily load tests in staging
3. **Monitoring**: Real-time database connection alerts
4. **Documentation**: Updated database best practices guide

##### ✅ Resolution Status
